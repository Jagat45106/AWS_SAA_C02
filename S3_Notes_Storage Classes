S3 Storage Classes Notes:-

Storage Classes:
       S3 Standard:
	        Key Features:

					Low latency and high throughput performance
					Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
					Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
					Designed for 99.99% availability over a given year
					Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
					Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
					S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes 

        S3 Intelligent-Tiering (Unknown - access frequency not known)
            Key Features:

					Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
					Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
					Automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns
					Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
					Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
					Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year
					Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
					Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
					S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes		
		
		S3 Standard-IA
		    Key Features:

					Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
					Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
					Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
					Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
					Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year
					Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
					Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
					S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes
					
		S3 One Zone-IA
			Key Features:

					Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
					Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects in a single Availability Zoneâ€ 
					Designed for 99.5% availability over a given year
					Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
					Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
					S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes
					
		Note: Because S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AWS Availability Zone, data stored in this storage class will be lost in the event of Availability Zone destruction.

		S3 Glacier

					Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
					Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
					Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
					Low-cost design is ideal for long-term archive
					Configurable retrieval times, from minutes to hours
					S3 PUT API for direct uploads to S3 Glacier, and S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects
					
		S3 Glacier Deep Archive)
			Key Features:

					Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
					Lowest cost storage class designed for long-term retention of data that will be retained for 7-10 years
