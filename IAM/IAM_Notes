Bydefault new USER identity no access to any service ( DENY-----ALLOW------DENY )
2 ways to access AWS infra: Username + Password (GUI) AND AccessKeyID + SecretAccessKey (Programmetic way, Command Line, API call etc)
AccessKeyID + SecretAccessKey => Can be view once, if you loose you have regenerate a new pair

ROLES:

	Roles can be used by the following:

		An IAM user in the same AWS account as the role
		An IAM user in a different AWS account than the role
		A web service offered by AWS such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
		An external user authenticated by an external identity provider (IdP) service that is compatible with SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect, or a custom-built identity broker.
		
		
Roles are IAM identity having specific set of permission that is assigned to other AWS services, resources to assume for making relevant service calls,API calls etc.
